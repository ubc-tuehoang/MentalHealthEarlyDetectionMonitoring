Using GenAI to analyze children's drawings for early detection of mental health issues

_THEN in 2017, I integrated IBM Watson into my mobile design project to identify children's mental health traits through their drawings. The mobile app analyzes the speed of their strokes, the size of the paintbrush used, and the range of colors employed. This analysis provides valuable insights into both their artistic process and the “Big Five” personality characteristics._

_NOW: This could be a groundbreaking AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize early healthcare detection and monitoring for children. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence algorithms (OpenAI, Gemini AI, and IBM Watson), to analyze children's drawings to provide valuable insights into their mental and emotional well-being._

The objective is to detect potential mental health issues at an early stage. By analyzing the speed, stroke patterns, paintbrush size, and color choices in children's drawings, the platform generates comprehensive reports that highlight any concerning patterns or behaviors.

The design is focused on kids, parents, educators, and healthcare professionals gain access to a powerful tool that facilitates proactive intervention and support, ultimately leading to better outcomes for children's mental health.
