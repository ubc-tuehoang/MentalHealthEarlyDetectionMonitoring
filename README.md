Using GenAI to analyze children's drawings for early detection of mental health issues

_THEN in 2017, I integrated IBM Watson into my mobile design project to identify children's mental health traits through their drawings. The mobile app analyzes the speed of their strokes, the size of the paintbrush used, and the range of colors employed. This analysis provides valuable insights into both their artistic process and the “Big Five” personality characteristics._

_NOW: This could be a groundbreaking AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize early healthcare detection and monitoring for children. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence algorithms (OpenAI, Gemini AI, and IBM Watson), to analyze children's drawings to provide valuable insights into their mental and emotional well-being._

The objective is to detect potential mental health issues at an early stage. By analyzing the speed, stroke patterns, paintbrush size, and color choices in children's drawings, the platform generates comprehensive reports that highlight any concerning patterns or behaviors.

The design is focused on kids, parents, educators, and healthcare professionals gain access to a powerful tool that facilitates proactive intervention and support, ultimately leading to better outcomes for children's mental health.

Key Features:

1. AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes GenAI algorithms to analyze children's drawings for early detection of mental health issues.

2. Comprehensive Insights: Provides detailed reports on psychological tendencies and potential concerns based on stroke speed, patterns, paintbrush size, and color choices.

3. Early Intervention: Facilitates proactive intervention and support by identifying potential mental health issues at an early stage.

4. User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive platform designed for parents, educators, and healthcare professionals to easily interpret and utilize the insights provided.

The ultimate goal is to transform the landscape of pediatric healthcare and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions that positively impact children's lives.

The initial proof of concept shows great promise:

The initial POC image depicts an individual deeply engaged in the process of creating a piece of art using colored pencils. Although the artist's face isn't visible, one can infer a sense of focus and intent concentration from the position of the hands and the poised pencil. There's a gentle harmony in the colors chosen for the artwork; warm hues appear to dominate, suggesting a certain warmth or emotional richness in the artist's choice of palette.

The artist's psychological mindset seems to be one of absorption and meticulous attention to detail. The way the hand carefully guides the pencil might indicate a patient and possibly contemplative state of mind, where each stroke is deliberately placed and each color choice is thoughtfully considered. The unfinished nature of the piece signals that the artist is in the midst of a creative journey, possibly exploring emotions, experimenting with color expression, or expressing a narrative through visual means.\n\nThe quiet intensity of the scene implies a private nexus where the external world fades, and the dialogue between artist and canvas becomes paramount. This process can be therapeutic, meditative, and deeply personal, as the artist imbues the piece with aspects of their inner thoughts and feelings, sometimes even articulating ideas and emotions that may not be fully conscious or expressible in words. The act of painting, therefore, becomes an intimate dance between the mind's inner workings and the artist's ability to manifest those into a visual form.

The second POC artwork showcased features an image of a teddy bear rendered primarily in monochromatic shades, suggesting use of charcoal or a similar medium. The painter has chosen a very limited palette, dominated by black, white, and grayscale tones. This choice of colors often conveys a somber or introspective mood and could resonate with feelings of nostalgia, solitude, or contemplation. The absence of vibrant colors might represent a stripping down to essentials, possibly reflecting a moment of simplicity or purity of emotion during the creative process. 

The subject—a teddy bear—commonly symbolizes innocence, comfort, and childhood memories. Its placement against the dark background makes it appear as if it's emerging from the shadows or perhaps vanishing into them. This interplay between light and dark could be a visual metaphor for hope amid despair, presence within absence, or the enduring power of comforting memories in darker times. 

Psychologically, the painter might have been in a reflective state of mind, contemplating themes of comfort, the past, or the simplicity of emotion that a teddy bear represents. The textured strokes and contrasts between the stark background and the softly illuminated bear could indicate a deliberate and sensitive approach to the subject, suggesting a personal connection or an emotional exploration by the artist during the painting process. The absence of other elements in the composition focuses the viewer's attention entirely on the bear, lending an intimacy to the piece that could mirror the artist's introspective mindset.
